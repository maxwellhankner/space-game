# LOST GRAVITY - Technical Implementation Plan

## Architecture Overview

### Core Systems
- **Rapier Physics World**: Single physics world managing all rigid bodies
- **GameContext**: State management for gravity modes and game state
- **Physics Components**: Modular physics bodies for character and world objects
- **Gravity Controllers**: State-specific physics behavior controllers

## Physics Implementation Strategy

### 1. Rapier World Setup
```jsx
// In Game.jsx - wrap Canvas with Physics provider
<Physics debug={false} gravity={[0, 0, 0]}>
  <GameWorld />
</Physics>
```

### 2. Character Physics Body
- **Base Rigid Body**: Dynamic body with mass and inertia
- **Collision Shape**: Capsule or cylinder for astronaut model
- **State Controllers**: Different physics behaviors per gravity mode

### 3. Gravity State Implementation

#### Zero-Gravity State
- **Physics**: Full dynamic body with physics collision responses
- **Movement**: Thruster-based propulsion (apply forces)
- **Rotation**: Quaternion-based look around (free rotation on all axes)
- **Gravity**: No gravity force applied
- **Character Behavior**: Floats freely, responds to all physics interactions
- **Control Scheme**: Mouse for rotation, keys for thruster activation

#### Box-Gravity State
- **Physics**: Dynamic body with NO physics collision responses
- **Movement**: Classic WASD walking with jumping
- **Rotation**: Euler angle look around (constrained to upright orientation)
- **Gravity**: Constant downward force (-Y direction)
- **Character Behavior**: Always upright, ground-based movement
- **Control Scheme**: Mouse for look around, WASD for movement

#### Sphere-Gravity State
- **Physics**: Dynamic body with NO physics collision responses
- **Movement**: Classic WASD walking with jumping (on curved surface)
- **Rotation**: Euler angle look around (constrained to spherical upright)
- **Gravity**: Radial force toward sphere center
- **Character Behavior**: Always "feet down" relative to sphere surface
- **Control Scheme**: Mouse for look around, WASD for movement

## Critical Technical Differences Between Gravity States

### Fundamental Control & Physics Differences

#### Zero-Gravity vs Box/Sphere-Gravity
- **Control System**: Completely different input handling
  - Zero-Gravity: Quaternion rotation + thruster forces
  - Box/Sphere: Euler angle look + WASD movement
- **Physics Response**: 
  - Zero-Gravity: Full physics collision responses
  - Box/Sphere: No physics collision responses (kinematic-like behavior)
- **Character Orientation**:
  - Zero-Gravity: Free-floating, any orientation
  - Box/Sphere: Constrained upright orientation

#### Box-Gravity vs Sphere-Gravity
- **Similarities**: Same control scheme, same physics behavior
- **Differences**: Only in how "upright" is calculated
  - Box: Vertical upright (Y-axis)
  - Sphere: Radial upright (toward sphere center)

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Seamless State Transitions
- **Problem**: Completely different control systems and physics behaviors
- **Solution**: State machine with smooth transitions

### Challenge 2: Character Orientation Management
- **Solution**: Quaternion-based orientation constraints

  - Control system switching during transitions

### Challenge 6: Control System Switching
- **Problem**: Completely different input handling between states

- **Implementation**:
  - Separate input handlers per gravity state
  - Gradual control system switching
  - Input buffering during transitions
